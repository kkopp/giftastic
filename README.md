# It's GifTastic

## About
Using the Giphy API, create an app where you can click on a button and get 10 gif files on a topic of your choosing.

Pretty straight forward, click on one of the links, 10 still images will show up on the page.  Clicking on one of the images will start the animation.  Clicking it again will pause it.

If you want to add a new button, just enter the new search term in the box and click the "Submit" button and a new button will be created.

At this time, the submit button works, but the search function does not work (no new gif images load...so sad, BUT, it is a work in progress)
